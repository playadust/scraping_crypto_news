0,376,"For more than 24 hours, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was down due to a server issue on Feb. 7. On Feb. 9, Binance resumed trading after successfully rebooting its server.Binance hack rumors refutedJohn McAfee, a security expert and a well-known public figure in the cryptocurrency space, continued to fuel controversy around Binance and rumors of hacking attacks, showing screenshots that circulated on various social media platforms.“I received dozens similar from a variety of sources. I'm not saying there was a hack. I'm merely asking for clarification. If a hack did happen and we are not immediately pursuing it, then the chances of recovery go to zero within 24 hours,” McAfee stated.In response to McAfee’s statement, which referenced a photoshopped image of the Binance website, the company’s CEO Changpeng Zhao stated:Immediately after McAfee released several statements on the issue, the Binance team along with its CEO Changpeng Zhao refuted the rumors, stating that Binance was not hacked. Binance went as far as to transfer funds from its cold wallet to hot wallet to show that the exchange was not hacked.The Binance team also encouraged McAfee not to spread false information and provided evidence that funds on the exchange are safe by publicly showing the cryptocurrency wallet addresses of the exchange.Zhao added that the exchange did not experience a hack, but an issue with its server and the team focused on recovering its data to enable trading.Difference between hack and minor server issuesRecently, many cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms were hacked. Coincheck experienced a $530 mln hacking attack as reported by Cointelegraph and yesterday, the largest Nano (RaiBlocks) exchange BitGrail experienced a security breach.The difference between a hacking attack and a minor server issue is that with security breaches, anyone can verify the movement of absurdly large amounts of cryptocurrencies from the cryptocurrency exchange’s wallets to external wallets, as seen in the case of Coincheck.Hours before the Coincheck team admitted to a hacking attack, many members of the cryptocurrency community released evidence that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of NEM were moved from the wallet of Coincheck to external wallets.Thus, if there is no evidence that large sums of funds in cryptocurrencies are transferred from the wallets of a cryptocurrency exchange to external wallets, it is irresponsible to suggest the possibility of a hacking attack.On Feb. 11, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao released a personal statement on the recent Binance server issue and the actions of McAfee.“The real helper was Mr. Mcafee, posting an obviously fake image about us being hacked. Everyone pitched in to help defend us. He united the community for us, and rallied such support, during a time when we needed it the most. Sometimes, things that look negative are actually positive.”Cryptocurrency exchanges have similar daily trading volumes as stock markets in regions like South Korea. Trading platforms process billions of dollars on a daily basis. As such, upon the occurrence of a hacking attack or a security breach, cryptocurrency exchanges often contact the authorities and cooperate with law enforcement to investigate the attack, as Coincheck did last month. Also, given the size of most major cryptocurrency exchanges, it is irresponsible to suggest the possibility of hacking attacks or security breaches without hard evidence.",55519
1,3833,"The Arizona Senate passed a bill on Feb. 8 to allow residents in the state to pay their taxes with cryptocurrencies, public records indicate.The Senate Bill 1091, which intends to enable cryptocurrencies for tax payment, was introduced Jan. 10, 2018 and passed by the Senate Finance Committee by a 4-3 vote on Jan. 24. On Feb. 8, the Senate passed the bill by a 16-13 margin, with one no-vote.The bill has now been sent to Arizona’s House of Representatives.If the bill is adopted, Arizona would become the first state in the U.S. to accept cryptocurrency tax payments by the year of 2020, as stated on the public record. The bill would allow taxpayers of the state to use “a payment gateway, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or any other cryptocurrency recognized by the department, using electronic peer-to-peer systems.”According to the bill, the Arizona Department of Revenue, upon receiving payments in crypto for “tax and any interest and penalties”, would be obligated to convert the cryptocurrency payments to U.S. dollars within 24 hours.Arizona State Republican Rep. Jeff Weninger, who co-sponsored the bill, said the tax measure intends to turn the state into a center of  “blockchain and digital currency technology in the future”. Referring to the tax bill, Weninger told Fox News this week:""It's one of a litany of bills that we're running that is sending a signal to everyone in the United States, and possibly throughout the world, that Arizona is going to be the place to be for blockchain and digital currency technology in the future.""In September, 2017, Cointelegraph reported that the municipality of Chiasso, Switzerland will enable its residents to pay taxes in Bitcoin starting January 2018, following the lead of Zug.",115596

3,249,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declined to provide information on Blockchain project Tezos requested by attorney David Silver via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Reuters reported Feb. 10.Silver represents plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against Tezos back in November, 2017, the second of several lawsuits against the company since it gathered $232 mln in a record-breaking ICO in July, 2017.In the response letter to Silver’s request for information, the SEC denied information disclosure regarding Tezos, citing Exemption 7(A) of FOIA. According to Reuters, the letter did not imply that Trezor was under SEC investigation.The SEC stated in the letter that such an exemption is used when the release of information could “be expected to interfere with enforcement activities”:""This exemption protects from disclosure records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement activities.

In the case of cryptocurrency, said trust is not provided by any given government or institution, but by Blockchain technology itself.Is crypto the ‘future of money’?Responding to the question of whether or not cryptocurrencies would ever become the “future of money”, Martin expressed doubt, stating that the problem cryptocurrency ostensibly solves may not actually need solving, at least not in “advanced economies”:“Cryptocurrencies arguably solve the problem of making payments in a trustless environment, but it is not obvious that this is a problem that needs solving, at least in the United States and other advanced economies.”He also cites lack of “convenience” and “extreme volatility” as factors that will keep cryptocurrencies from mainstream adoption as a currency, noting “people do tend to trust financial institutions to handle payments and central banks to maintain the value of money”.As Lee himself noted in the interview, there is an inverse relationship between trust in the fiat financial system and interest in Bitcoin. During the 2015 financial crisis in Greece, the number of Bitcoin transactions on the network hit a record peak.A disclaimer at the end of the NY Fed interview makes it clear that the economists’ opinions “do not necessarily reflect” the official position of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System as a whole.",45768

First came the destruction and devastation from Hurricane Irma and Maria. Then came disorganized relief efforts, and allegations back and forth as to whether Puerto Rico or the US were to blame. Even today, only 60 percent of Puerto Rico has access to reliable electricity. And the Tax Reform bill that just passed the Congress imposed new tariffs on US companies that hold Puerto Rican subsidiaries.Still, some see in Puerto Rico a budding crypto tax paradise. Some tax advisers are telling their clients to pick up and move to Puerto Rico. As the theory goes, after establishing residency they can sell their cryptocurrency holdings 100 percent tax-free. Sounds great! Where does one sign up?If true, this could be a boon to the Puerto Rican economy, not to mention to those individuals sitting on mountains of appreciated cryptocurrency assets. But does this Puerto Rico tax scheme actually work? Like everything in the world of cryptocurrency taxes, great caution is in order.The IRS is just getting around to developing a strategy to identify, assess and collect the billions of dollars in taxes from cryptocurrencies that some believe are going unreported. The notion that US and Puerto Rico tax authorities will allow millions (if not billions) in cryptocurrency sales to escape taxation entirely is pretty optimistic, to say the least.Will the US tax crypto sales after a move to Puerto Rico?Generally speaking, the IRS does not require a US taxpayer to include income from “sources within Puerto Rico” if they have resided in Puerto Rico for an entire taxable year. That part seems good.However, there are a whole host of rules governing “bona fide residency” that can apply, as well as information reporting requirements to the IRS. So one would need to truly move to Puerto Rico, not just go through some of the motions. Plus, sales may still need to be reported to the IRS, even if they’re not subject to US tax.Of course, the more significant worry is that the IRS will seek to tax these crypto sales from Puerto Rico, even if one legitimately establishes residency there. How could this be done? Possibly under complex regulations governing “property of former US residents.” The IRS might argue that much of the gain from a crypto sale in Puerto Rico should be taxed in the US. For example, take someone that bought Bitcoin back in 2015 and only moved to Puerto Rico in 2018. The IRS might argue that nearly all of the appreciation occurred prior to the move to Puerto Rico and that therefore the IRS has the right to tax nearly all of the gains from the sale. You may have to wait ten years before you sell to avoid any US tax.Would the IRS prevail if this issue went to court? Some tax advisers apparently think not. But with big tax dollars at stake, caution is definitely in order. The IRS is just ramping up its efforts to tax cryptocurrencies, and it might not take the most taxpayer-friendly positions. The idea that someone can move to Puerto Rico with appreciated cryptocurrencies, potentially worth billions of dollars, and sell them entirely tax-free, sounds good but perhaps too good to be true.  Que Pasa con Puerto Rico?The other side of the equation is Puerto Rico. Let’s assume that in a perfect world, the IRS conceded that the sale of crypto in Puerto Rico (after moving) was not subject to any US tax.Would Puerto Rico try to tax these sales? Again, some advisers say no, and point to tax incentives that Puerto Rico has for built-in capital gains of new residents. But here too, caution is definitely in order. Consulting with Puerto Rico tax experts first seems prudent, to avoid an expensive mishap.  For example, the Puerto Rican exemptions might only apply to gains that were accrued after the individual becomes a bonafide resident of Puerto Rico. Plus, with state budget severely strapped, and the local economy flailing, it might pay to expect the unexpected.

7,838,"A new study by Recorded Future has found that Bitcoin is losing its position as the number one currency on the Darknet markets. The Internet tech company analyzed 150 of the most active message boards, marketplaces, and illicit service providers and noticed that the Darknet communities sentiments toward Bitcoin have taken a turn.The Darknet economyThe Darknet is an Internet that uses non-standard communication protocols and ports to make it a bit more difficult for the digital identities of users to be revealed. The Darknet requires users to run a special software,  the most popular being TOR. to connect to the Internet. One of the main purposes of using the Darknet is to make the information provider and the person accessing the information difficult to trace. Because of this privacy feature, the Darknet has become famous for its Darknet markets like Silk Road that allowed users to effectively exchange anything,  legal or illegal over an Amazon-like marketplace. The anonymous Internet is said to attract criminals and those interested in black market activities as well.A backlogged networkIn mid-2016, Recorded Future noticed that the 150 entities they were analyzing were all expressing concerns regarding the functionality, usability and security of Bitcoin in the Darknet economy. Although it was a relatively mild increase compared to the increase in interest in Bitcoin in the latter half of 2017, the Bitcoin network was beginning to become overloaded with traffic which resulted in higher transaction fees for those using the Darknet markets. On Dec. 23, 2017 transaction fees were $52.18.Recorded Future found that the average transaction size on the Darknet is $50-$300. If an individual tried to transact on Dec. 23, 2017 – it could have been the case that the transaction fee was more costly than the amount being transacted. One member of a Darknet message board posted this on the forum he uses:“What's happening at the moment is incomprehensible. Despite that I've used the recommended commission fees, my transactions have remained pending for the past three days, and my work has been paralyzed. Dear vendors, please implement alternative payment options; otherwise, I will miss out on this Christmas season.”A Christmas miracleThe backlogged queue on the Bitcoin network was making it difficult for some individuals in the underworld to conduct their business. This users transaction was logged so far back in the queue that it took several days for it to become verified. To combat double-spending attacks, most vendors on the Darknet adopted a rule requiring three confirmations before treating transactions as complete. Because a transaction cannot be complete until the payment has been confirmed, this user was effectively frozen out of conducting his “business.”Although he was worried he would “miss out on this Christmas season,” his Christmas miracle was about to occur. To combat, the exuberant transaction fees that were increasing daily, vendors began accepting alternative payment options. The study found that Litecoin was the second most popular currency with 30 percent of all vendors accepting LTC, and Dash the third most popular currency, with 20 percent of all vendors accepting DASH.Other Darknet studiesBack in 2016, economist Tuur Demeester was in the process of researching the Darknet markets. Demeester turned to r/DarkNetMarkets to see if the community could provide him with the statistics he was looking for: what percentage of trades on the Darknet was conducted with BTC?  Was DarkCoin used and how often? How many Bitcoins were spent on the Darknet on a daily/monthly/yearly basis? But Demeester was not met with any useful answers from the community.Prior to Demeester's endeavor, The Digital Citizens Alliance released a table with statistics about the number of drug listings on the Darknet markets in August 2014, but this table provided no information regarded prices, trade volumes and preferred payment methods.Image source: Digital Citizens AllianceFurthermore, Nicolas Cristin, an associate research professor in the School of Computer Science and in Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) together with Kyle Soska, a Ph.D. candidate in CMU’s school of electrical and computer engineering back in 2013, conducted a study from 2013-2015 to get a handle on the Darknet market economy.When the Silk Road was shut down in October 2013, Cristin and Soska noticed that the take-down spawned the development of anonymous online marketplaces, which continue to evolve to this day. Cristin and Soska used long-term measurement analysis on 16 different marketplaces for over two years (2013– 2015) to calculate the growth of the online anonymous marketplace ecosystem. Their research documented the types of goods being sold, the effect – or lack – of adversarial events, such as law enforcement operations and large-scale frauds, on the overall size of the economy. The two also gained insights into how vendors are diversifying and replicating across marketplaces, and how vendor security practices (e.g., PGP adoption) are evolving.Payment methods are evolvingRecorded Futures study concluded by stating that the efforts that vendors are taking to diversify acceptable payment methods on the Darknet markets will continue. Although payment methods like Litecoin and Dash are becoming more popular, Recorded Future still expects Bitcoin to have a place in the Darknet economy- just a much smaller market share than it currently has. Recorded future also warns that with increased popularity in digital currencies will come an increase in malicious tools like ransomware that will try to take advantage of the mainstream trends in cryptocurrency.",99007
8,569,"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchangeCryptocurrencies are a part of evolving technology and are still in a nascent stage.So, they are likely to remain quite volatile compared to the other matured asset classes.The early investors in cryptocurrencies were mostly technology enthusiasts who saw a future in them. After the humongous returns of 2017, more and more institutional investors want to join the party.This is changing the way the cryptocurrencies perform. In the past 90-days, the correlation between the S&P 500 and cryptocurrencies has risen sharply to 33 percent, which is way above the previous high reading of 19 percent, according to Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. The long-term average is way lower at 1 percent.2018 has turned out to be hugely negative to both the stock market and the cryptocurrencies. Let’s see if the top coins point towards a resumption of the downtrend, similar to the S&P 500.BTC/USDWhile it is better to trade with the trend, at times, strong counter-trend rallies can also be profitable. Bitcoin is trading inside a descending channel with both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA trending down. This shows that it is in a confirmed downtrend. The current pullback is likely to face resistance at the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA.In a downtrend, when the selling is overdone, and prices reach attractive levels, it can offer a short-term trading opportunity.We believe that if the BTC/USD pair holds above the February 06 lows during the next leg down, the traders will have an opportunity to enter long positions. The ideal time to buy would be when prices break out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. The profit objective of such a trade will be a move towards the resistance line of the descending channel.However, if the price breaks down and goes on to make a new low, the above-mentioned trading opportunity will be invalidated.   ETH/USDEthereum plunged from $1,265 levels to $565.54 levels within nine days. The February 06 low also coincided with the support line of the descending channel.  The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, which points to the possibility of another leg down. We expect the current leg of the pullback to face resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the ETH/USD pair stays above the February 06 lows, it will point to a possible short-term bottom, which can be purchased.We should avoid the trade if the cryptocurrency sinks to new lows.  BCH/USDYesterday, Bitcoin Cash made a strong move up. It is now likely to move towards the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA where it might face strong resistance.    The BCH/USD pair will become positive in the short-term once it breaks out and sustains above the downtrend line. We expect it to form a bullish setup in the next few days. The first target objective is a move to $2,072 levels.We currently don’t find any bullish pattern; hence, we do not recommend any trade on it.  XRP/USDRipple has caused a lot of heartburn to its investors. At the current price, it is still down about 67 percent from its peak. It has been trading in a small range for the past five days and is not finding much interest among the buyers.However, we believe that if the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line, we can expect it to attract further buying, which can propel it towards the overhead resistance of $1.74. Therefore, we need to wait for a breakout above the 20-day EMA before buying.Our view of a short-term bottom will prove to be wrong if the cryptocurrency breaks down of the lows formed on February 06.         XLM/USDStellar has become range bound for the past three days. Intraday, it is facing resistance at the previous support of $0.41.A break above this level will again face selling at the resistance line of the descending channel. The trend on the XLM/USD pair will change only after it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel.Stellar will become negative if it sustains below $0.30 levels.LTC/USDLitecoin is close to the 20-day EMA, which has acted as strong resistance on two previous occasions.If the bulls break out of this level, they are likely to face another round of selling around the $175 mark, which has dual resistance, from the downtrend line and the horizontal line.Once the LTC/USD pair breaks out of these resistances, it will probably start a new uptrend, which can carry it to $243 and after that to $307.Traders can initiate long positions once the cryptocurrency breaks out and sustains above the $175 levels. We don’t have a specific stop loss position. We can update the same one once our buy levels are triggered.ADA/BTCCardano is not finding buyers. It continues to struggle near the lows formed on February 02. It has also formed a descending triangle pattern, which is a bearish setup.  If the ADA/BTC pair breaks down and sustains below the horizontal support of 0.00004070, it will complete the descending triangle formation. After that, it will most likely slide to 0.0000246 levels where buying should emerge.Our bearish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks out and closes above the downtrend line of the triangle.   NEO/USDNEO is facing resistance at the moving averages, as outlined in our previous analysis. Additionally, it formed an inside day pattern yesterday, February 08, and it is likely to repeat the same pattern today.These successive inside day patterns have the same effect as the coiling of the spring. Once the bulls breakout above $120 levels, a quick rally to the downtrend line at $140 might take place. Traders can keep an initial stop loss of $100, which can be trailed higher to reduce the risk.On the other hand, if the NEO/USD pair breaks down instead of breaking out, it will become negative, and a retest of the February 06 lows is likely.EOS/USDEOS has broken out of the descending channel, which points to a waning bearish momentum. However, it has been facing resistance close to the $8.97 mark for a couple of days. A break above this level is likely to propel the cryptocurrency higher towards $10 and then to $12.Very short-term traders can initiate a long position in the EOS/USD pair at $9 and keep an SL of $7.5. Still, this is a very risky trade; traders should use only 50 percent of their usual allocation.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange; the charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.",168049
9,779,"Japanese cryptocurrency investors will pay between 15 and 55 percent on their profits declared on their annual tax filings this year, Bloomberg reports Thursday, Feb. 8.The Japanese National Tax Agency had already ruled “last year” that capital gains on transactions of virtual currency are considered “miscellaneous income,” Bloomberg writes.The tax on cryptocurrency profits is higher than the around 20 percent tax levied on profits from stocks and foreign currencies, with the higher percentage tax applying to those who earn more than 40 mln yen a year (about $367,600).In comparison, South Korea had announced in Jan. that crypto exchanges will be taxed 24.2 percent, in line with the existing tax policy for corporations.According to Bloomberg, around 40 percent of Bitcoin (BTC) trading recently has been against the yen, meaning the country will receive a large revenue from taxing crypto.Image source: BloombergBloomberg reports that the Japanese National Tax Agency is creating a database of cryptocurrency investors, potentially to ensure enforcement of the tax laws, as well as retaining teams in Tokyo and Osaka to watch electronic trading.The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also reported today that they have created a 10 person team of investigators aimed at tracking down crypto users that failed to report their profits in their tax declarations.Japan had recognized Bitcoin as a legal method of payment back in April 2017, a step towards helping the government prevent unregulated exchanges from hacks and mismanagement like the Mt.

10,241,"At the time of writing, it could take over a thousand years to mine an entire block on the Bitcoin Blockchain using consumer grade hardware. One whole block is the minimum amount required to mine in order to receive adequate compensation for your work. To address this issue, Oasis Mining, a new pool-mining platform promises the lowest costs, and highest Return On Investment (ROI).Joining forcesIf you live in the Western Hemisphere, it is likely that electricity costs are high enough that the prospect of getting involved in Bitcoin or altcoin mining is something of a false economy.If you live in a property with energy expenses included as part of the rent - you might be thinking that you have a golden opportunity for taking advantage of free energy. Unfortunately, you are out of luck. The recent surge of opportunists has led to convictions and even jail time in countries such as China and the Netherlands.Pool mining allows various miners to join forces and resources towards the mining of a block in cooperation with each other.This helps to minimize the mining time required by individual users who possess single machines or smaller mining farms who would otherwise be waiting a considerable amount of time for a payout. Miners share the dividends in proportion to their contributions. Whilst this may yield a smaller amount of revenue per person compared to solo mining, this revenue is received much more consistently and frequently.Oasis Mining offers a advanced and comprehensive but easy to use interface. The platform enables its users to take advantage of a wide plethora of mining related services - at some of the lowest costs, and highest ROIs.Currently supported coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash. Some of the headlining features of Oasis Mining include the usage of the latest and greatest in mining software and hardware. Furthermore, the company’s farm is located in an area with a stable electricity supply.The company claims that recent scare reports, such as those suggesting that bitcoin mining surpasses the capability of existing energy infrastructures are not an applicable concern when using this system.Mining At All Levels of ExpertiseOasis Mining also allows users to sell the hashpower of their hardware to a growing community of miners.The company claims to offer extremely competitive pre-sales prices along with a transparent pricing structure and immediate withdrawals. They also promise unlimited contract lengths and unlimited lifetime service to reward those who enjoy the service enough to continue subscription.Oasis Mining also has a presence on Facebook.

11,258,"Hong Kong’s financial regulator vowed to keep “policing” cryptocurrency and ICO markets Friday during a fresh warning to potential investors.In an announcement from the territory’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), CEO Ashley Alder said that following a vetting of exchanges and ICO providers for compliance, “market professionals” should also play their role in ensuring the legality of token issuance and exchange. This echoes similar sentiments from US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in December.“We will continue to police the market and enforce when necessary,” he commented. “But we are also urging market professionals to do proper gatekeeping to prevent frauds or dubious fundraising and to assist us in ensuring compliance with the law.”Hong Kong has sought to strike a balance between permissiveness and investor protection regarding cryptocurrency and ICO regulation.In contrast to mainland China, where crypto trading and ICOs are both de facto banned, lawmakers have chosen a middle-of-the-road approach, with the SFC issuing warnings instead of restrictions prior to China’s ban in September 2017.The result has been a burgeoning crypto startup scene in Hong Kong, with major international crypto exchange Bitfinex among the best-known residents. Binance, currently the world’s second largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has also been based there, despite CEO Zhao Changpeng opting for a multi-country presence.As China seeks to close the net on remaining exchange loopholes, the outlook for Hong Kong meanwhile remains broadly similar to before, the SFC hints.“If investors cannot fully understand the risks of cryptocurrencies and ICOs or they are not prepared for a significant loss, they should not invest,” Julia Leung, the organization’s executive director of intermediaries continued in the announcement, underscoring the responsibility of investors themselves.“Investors who store their fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies with unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges should be aware of the risks of hacking and misappropriation of assets.”",51751
12,383,"During the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) senate hearing on February 6 2018, SEC chairman Jay Clayton emphasized that initial coin offerings (ICOs) will be met with tighter regulations, while true cryptocurrencies will be embraced with smart policies.Hard for ICOsAt the senate hearing (as previously reported by Cointelegraph) Jay Clayton noted that every ICO token the SEC has seen so far is considered a security and explained that if a crypto-asset issued by a company increases in value over time depending on the performance of the company, it is considered a security:""You can call it a coin, but if it functions like a security, it’s a security.”Although most ICOs do not offer equity or a stake in their projects in order to exempt themselves from SEC regulations, if the SEC considers tokens that increase in value based on the performance of Blockchain projects featuring the tokens, then virtually every single ICO can be considered as a security.Clayton also sent a warning to ICO projects and token issuers in the market, stating that the SEC intends to impose stricter restrictions on the ICO ecosystem:“A note for professionals in these markets: those that engage in semantic gymnastics … are squarely within the crosshairs of our enforcement division.”Jay Clayton, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange CommissionTrue cryptocurrenciesHowever, Clayton make a distinction between ICO tokens and major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. He labelled ICO tokens securities, while classifying the others as ""true cryptocurrencies,” promising smart and practical regulations for exchanges and investors dealing with these cryptocurrencies.Clayton referred to true cryptocurrencies as public Blockchain networks with native cryptocurrencies either mined or produced by the public. If a certain company has control over the monetary supply of its crypto-asset distributed to its users and the value of the token is based on the performance of the company, Clayton reiterated that the token is a security and falls under the regulations imposed by the SEC.Both CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo and senator Mark Warner said that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot be separated from their respective Blockchain networks. As such, Blockchain does not exist without native cryptocurrencies.“I don't think you can separate cryptocurrencies from Blockchain,” said senator Warner, as chairman Giancarlo echoed a similar sentiment. ""It’s important to remember that if there was no Bitcoin, there would be no Blockchain or distributed ledger technology,” chairman Giancarlo added - a phrase that has already become famous.What can the market expect?The ICO space and projects within that industry are likely to face difficulties in conducting token crowdsales due to regulatory conflict with the SEC. Blockchain projects may still be able to conduct ICOs outside of the US, but there remains the possibility that the SEC may target a project with investors based in the US.For many months, the majority of ICOs worldwide have excluded US-based investors from token crowdsales due to the strict SEC regulatory regime. In fact, many ICOs have already transitioned to private token sales, distributing tokens to buyers on a whitelist. This trend is likely to continue throughout the long-term, and eventually, public token sales will no longer be offered.The outlook appears different from the global cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency exchanges and investors can expect more friendly regulations to be rolled out in the future. As hinted by chairman Giancarlo, a national licensing program and unified regulatory frameworks could be implemented in the short-term, similar to the system employed by Japan.“We owe it this new generation to respect their enthusiasm about virtual currencies with a thoughtful and balanced response, not a dismissive one.”J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the US Commodities and Futures Trading CommissionCurrently, cryptocurrency regulation differs from state to state and for both small and large-scale cryptocurrency companies. This variance in regulation often leads to an increase in legal costs which can be up to millions of dollars.",40646

Sarov is still closed to visitors from both abroad and Russia without the proper permission, and the border is surrounded by barbed wire fences and military patrols.Tatiana Zalesskaya, the head of the press service for the research institute, told Interfax that “as far as [she] is aware,” a criminal case has been launched against the engineers:""There has been an unsanctioned attempt to use computer facilities for private purposes including so-called mining [...] it is a technically hopeless and criminally punishable activity""The center’s supercomputer, which has a capacity of 1 petaflop -- 1,000 trln calculations per second -- was not connected to the internet for security reasons. When the engineers tried to bring it online to utilize its power for mining, the security department was able to stop and apprehend the engineers.Legislation that is expected to legalize Bitcoin in Russia is in the works, but the specifics of how mining would be regulated, with miners perhaps needing to register with a central authority, is not yet clear. In mid-January, Cointelegraph reported that Russian businessman Aleksey Kolesnik had reportedly bought two power plants for future cryptocurrency mining operations.The engineers arrested this week were not the first to think of using former Soviet military spaces for mining.

A laptop and documents were taken as evidence by the CSD.A source told The Bangkok post that evidence showed that Medvedev had over 100,000 Bitcoin (BTC) at the time of his arrest, approximately $820 mln. However, the Post wrote that Medvedev’s 100,000 BTC was equal to about 100 mln baht, when it is actually equal to 26,523,087,316 baht.Medvedev allegedly was an administrator for the Dark Web site Infraud - whose slogan was “In Fraud We Trust” - that dealt primarily in the sale of stolen credit cards and identities and illegally obtained government documents.On Feb. 7 the US Department of Justice (DOJ) had released an indictment of 36 individuals, not including Medvedev, charged with participating in Infraud.

And it is following this same path when it comes to Blockchain development. The Netherlands ranks in the top five countries when it comes to digital economies.Amsterdam is named the best tech startup city in Europe, the digital city Groningen is hosting the largest Blockchain hackathon in the world, and Arnhem is the place with high concentrations of merchants that accept Bitcoin payments. This has allowed the Dutch to experiment with payments using volatile cryptocurrencies with their regulation still a distant concept.Dutch Blockchain Action Agenda is the driving force for the innovative application of this technology in both products and services. Under the label “Dutch Digital Delta,” government, industry, knowledge institutions even the Royal family’s Prince Constantijn, with over 20 organizations in the financial sector, energy, and logistics, are active in this initiative.Clearer policy and regulations were needed around the developing cryptocurrency, Blockchain sphere, agreed Dutch politicians, cryptocurrency companies and regulators, who appeared in the House of Representatives at a hearing on Jan. 24, 2018FintechA few years ago the Central Bank of the Netherlands (DNB) created its own cryptocurrency called DNBcoin, for internal circulation only, to understand better how it works. After studying it, DNB concluded that Blockchain might be “naturally applicable in fintech” for the settlement of complex financial transactions, cross-border payments, securities transactions and document and identity validation. At the hearing, DNB representative indicated that while “DNBCoin is still under consideration, it is also investigating a combination of Blockchain based cross-border payment services where cryptos are converted to fiat currencies and prepaid crypto debit cards.” DNB stated “it supports the EU having extended its anti-money laundering directives to include digital money, acknowledging that the Netherlands will adopt it into national laws within 18 months.” And reiterated that “cryptocurrencies are not legal tender, they will not be banned, since it would obstruct blockchain innovation.”The five Dutch Banks, which control over 90 percent of the Netherlands’ retail banking market are exploring implementing Blockchain technology in their operations. ABN AMRO and Rabobank joined SWIFT global payments innovation project. ING has completed the testing of Blockchain-powered trade settlement platform in partnership with Calypso and the R3 consortium.  And NIBC has set up an Innovation Lab to stimulate the adoption of technological advancements within the bank as well as to enter strategic partnerships with innovative Blockchain companies.Willem Vermeend, the first official “FinTech Ambassador of the Netherlands,” said:“Blockchain will become a critical part of the financial sector, but what’s needed is collaboration.  There is a lot of creativity in the Netherlands. The problem is that I have spoken to 20 parties who do not know what each other is doing.”The Dutch government is exploring how to use Blockchain technology to improve service delivery to citizens as the catalyzer for democracy, transparency, and participation. So far, more than 30 pilots were concluded utilizing Blockchain technology in a variety of areas like income tax, identity, logistics, autonomous vehicles, debt counseling, etc.  ICOWith 3,200 startup tech companies hitting a scale-up phase in the Netherlands, Initial Coin Offering (ICO) offers a new way of fundraising enabled by digital currencies and Blockchain technology. Currently, the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) does not regulate ICOs.""When it comes to innovation and developing markets, the Netherlands always held a forward-thinking stance. ICO initiatives are not an exception. The Dutch landscape comprises of bottom-up initiatives such as meet-ups and conferences, Ethereum DEV NL, Skycoin Netherlands, and Bitcoin Wednesday, a thriving startup ecosystem with (pre-) ICO fundraising entities. Not surprisingly, the advisors of some of the most successful ICOs of the caliber of Bancor, Kik, and Monetha live in the Netherlands,” explained Emanuele Francioni, founder of Web3 Ventures.Merel van Vroonhoven, chairman of the AFM, warned:“Although the AFM sees the possibilities of Blockchain technology for financial services, it points to the high risks of ICOs in the current hype. The high risk of scams and loss of intake combined with the hype around ICOs at the moment is a dangerous cocktail.""At the latest hearing, AFM urged that ICOs needed to be regulated at an international and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) level because they are cross-border by nature.Last year Prince Constantijn joined the High-Level Group of Innovators that advises the European Commission (EC). On Feb. 1, 2018, the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum announced that “it is partnering with ConsenSys, an Ethereum powered global venture production studio, for the benefit of the single European Union (EU) market, ensuring they work collaboratively across borders to help integrate and consolidate views, analysis and visions coming from the Netherlands in a forum at EU level,” explained EC Spokesperson Nathalie Vandystadt.Individual taxation of cryptocurrencyThe Netherlands is an exciting place for Blockchain and cryptocurrency investments. Investors are urged to take into consideration applicable cross-border tax laws while forming crypto or token investment decisions.“The Netherlands’ Finаnсе Miniѕtеr announced that the Dutch gоvеrnmеnt would be соnѕidеring cryptocurrencies and thе like аѕ “barter items” which are to be declared as a capital asset of the personal income tax return to the extent a person is not someone who actively trades in cryptocurrencies.  As such, cryptocurrencies are taxed as income from savings and investments. This means you have to take its value in Euros on Jan. 1st of the year and declare this value. A fictitious yield is to be calculated over the fair market value of the taxpayers’ savings and investments, reduced by his liabilities, per Jan. 1st. This fictitious yield is taxed at applicable rates against 30 percent” explained Martijn de Jong of Amstone law firm.“Non-resident individual taxpayers are only taxed on certain Netherlands sourced savings and investments. Should the non-resident taxpayer’s involvement be assumed to exceed passive management of funds, Dutch taxation in box one could apply.

The project aims to create a full ecosystem where Influencers and SNS users around the world will be able to post, discover and book social media sharing economy information on the Internet and mobile tablet, the company’s white paper states.The company is creating a sharing economy system which works similar to Airbnb. A ‘host’ can purchase one influential post, ‘buy’ an influencer for up to several months or even for a year.In the influencer marketing industry, up to 40 percent of the fees going to influencers are being taken by the agency that acts as an intermediary. According to PATRON, they have built a Blockchain-based solution to help solve a middlemen problem. The commission fee currently being paid could be replaced by a tokenized market that would have a transparent business “skim.”New business modelThe founder of PATRON, Atsushi Hisatsumi, is an influencer first and entrepreneur second. He is an award-winning singer, DJ and dancer. Much of his background in business is around marketing and working with influencers to create better solutions and reach for them.By tokenizing the market and making it much easier to build a brand and monetize it, PATRON could open up a whole new tier of influencers who could come to market. Additionally, the initial difficulty most companies have in contacting influencers will be ameliorated by creating a platform for them to operate upon.Decentralized platforms run based on the power of smart contracts and the automation they enable. PATRON is planning to replace the existing business model with a system that makes way more sense to the customers and creators.Two economic effects could result from the implementation of a platform like Patron. First, both sponsors and influencers would end up with more money in their pockets. Second, you would see it become cheaper to sponsor influencers, which could make it possible for more influencers to come online.The business of being an intermediary is under attack as more people realize there are more efficient ways to do things, and PATRON is one example of an innovative technology which could disrupt an old business model.The ICO stage of developmentRight now, PATRON is in the midst of its ICO. They are entering their pre-sale stage soon, and are aiming for a subscription of $10 mln before the public ICO.ICO’s are necessary when a company reaches a point where they need much more money in order to carry out their plans. The money from the PATRON ICO will be focused towards three different facets of expansion. First, the personnel who develop the applications and infrastructure need to be financed. But this also means that an initial investment for setting up shop in San Francisco will be required. Finally, some money will be required to set up studios and workspaces for influencers.During the ICO there will be a 30 percent bonus during the premium period in order to encourage participation. The pre-sale will begin on Feb. 14th.Will Bartlett Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

19,488,"Popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced on its site today, Feb. 9, that it has completed its system upgrade after technical difficulties resulted in significant delays.The company’s post confirmed all functionality would return at 10am UTC Feb. 9, with Binance offering a two-week 70% discount on trading fees as a sign of “gratitude for their unwavering support throughout the upgrade process.”Binance has risen to international fame in the brief six-month period it has existed on the cryptocurrency exchange market.This week, CEO Changpeng Zhao was named as one of the crypto industry’s “richest people” in a first-of-its-kind list from Forbes, having already appeared on mainstream media as an industry expert, even publicly criticising Warren Buffett.As of January, 2018 Binance was the largest trading platform in the world, Cointelegraph reporting user numbers increasing by 240,000 per hour and restrictions being placed on new sign-ups.Despite a “slowdown” in the complex procedures used to facilitate the upgrade, Zhao assured users on social media that the integrity of data was not at risk at any point.“There was a DDoS attack on our cloud provider, resolved, but still some lingering effects,” he added in a further recent twitter update.The exchange had managed to refute accusations a hack was taking place as the technical issues unfolded Thursday, Feb. 8.",62412
20,379,"Popular Ethereum wallet interface MyEtherWallet (MEW) has released a unexpected alternative product, MyCrypto.com, one of MEW’s original developers announced in a blog post Feb. 9.MEW has become one of the most popular Ethereum and ERC20 token storage management tools over the past year, and will continue to exist along with a new project, which has an almost identical interface.In the blog post, one of MEW’s original developers Taylor Monahan gave a brief history of the project and the impetus behind her creating MyCrypto, while remaining silent on relations between herself and her fellow co-developer of MEW, known as Kvhnuke.“MyEtherWallet LLC was sufficient for the early stages of growth. MyCrypto is designed with next-level scaling in mind from the beginning,” Monahan explained in the post, adding she had spent nine months assembling a team to oversee all operations. She also added:“Kvhnuke remains in control of the MEW github repository, the MEW domain, the AWS instances, and the MyEtherWallet social media accounts.”MEW’s structure has allowed it to avoid the common pitfalls ‘true’ wallet providers have struggled with increasingly as cryptocurrency has gained value and an influx of new users.Ostensibly designed to serve even more users via a similar setup, MyCrypto will enter public beta testing in the near future, Monahan nonetheless stating she was “terrified” about the road ahead. She continued:“I was terrified — am terrified — at the potential harm this change will have on myself, the team, and/or the Ethereum community but ultimately, the risks created by continuing down the road we were on are greater than the risks of splitting to a new brand, new company, new name, and new domain. While contemplating this decision, I began to see that my inaction would be the only thing that guaranteed my failure.”Online, the circumstances surrounding the changes continue to cause suspicion and confusion among users.While MEW has not yet published any comment about the new brand, curious statements about what staff describe as an “unlawful social media account switch” on Twitter have coincided with the release of the MyCrypto news.",53388

22,291,"No matter which sci-fi story we choose, let it be the galactic adventures of Star Trek or the dark side of Darth Vader in Star Wars, all of them include something humanity has always been dreaming of - controlling things with our mere thoughts. Nowadays with mind-controlled drones races and prosthetics limbs with fingers bending at your will, this future is closer than it has ever been.Although most of this technology is still in relatively early stages, some entrepreneurs like the team behind the startup company Neurogress have big plans to bring it to the masses. Additionally, the Swiss company wants to take matters to another level and combine the science of mind-controlled devices with another huge trend in the digital world, the Blockchain technology.Big plans for a big futureNeurogress’s project is nothing short of ambitious. The company is planning to develop artificial intelligence (AI) based software for mind (or neural) led tools to maximize their full potential. The company’s short term vision is to create software that will allow people to control different types of devices with their thoughts. They want the software to be able to recognize brain commands via a neurointerface contained in a non-invasive headband that is worn (nothing needs to be implanted). The software will be able to translate these brain commands into actions. For example, a prosthetic arm can grab and lift a cup of coffee for you to enjoy simply by thinking it.The programme is designed to be able to use existing statistics from a common database to help users to quickly adapt their devices and use them more efficiently. Initially, the APIs of the software will only be open for developers, but if enough funding is obtained Neurogress plans to make it open source.Blockchain will come into the picture in the developmental stage, however initial plans are that the company will base their system and platform on Ethereum smart contracts. It is also planned implement the project into the Smart Environment, controlling devices around you with your mind with a help of a single neurointerface. Neurogress is yet to decide which platform will be ideal for its long term needs, be it Ethereum, IOTA, EOS, another emerging technology or a native Blockchain cryptocurrency - this will be decided when the project reaches its development stage.Mining with your mindInitial funding is collected through a TGE (Token Generation Event). The pre-TGE starts on February 10 2018 where Neurogress will issue Neurogress tokens (NRG) to people interested in the project to purchase. These tokens are the native currency for the platform. Users will be able to purchase software or devices on the Neurogress marketplace, pay for developers to create codes, train machine learning algorithms for rewards, design and improve applications and other transactions on the Neugrogress platform.The machine learning process constantly develops the advanced algorithms, which accelerates the neurocontrol mastering. This decentralized approach allows developers to use Neurogress algorithms for running their systems as well as for providing data sets to train AI.Once sufficient funding is obtained, the company plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency - the target is within a year of the project’s start. People will be able to mine with the use of “Proof of Neural Activity” concept where the mining algorithm processes a user’s brain activity.However, it’s important to highlight citizens and residents of the USA, Singapore and Switzerland are not able to purchase any NRG tokens due to various taxation and regulatory barriers in these countries. Investors should also understand tokens purchases are final, and even if the project’s outcome won’t be as they expected there are no refunds.Thinking fastThe potential of mind-controlled devices are vast, and perhaps creativity will be the only limit. While the current state of the mind-controlled devices is still very expensive, and training periods for users can take up more than a year, companies like Neurogress are the drivers of this market potentially worth billions of dollars in the future.Neurogress envisions it will be able to apply its software to a wide range of tools (not only drones or prosthetics). The company’s plan is to implement its product via collaborations with other manufacturers into industries such as medicine, robotics, gaming, transportation and perhaps even construct a mind-controlled giant crane.Disclaimer.

The petro’s white paper released Jan. 30 explains that the idea for the petro came from Hugo Chavez, who had envisioned a “strong currency backed by raw materials.”Mora said that Brazilian businesspeople are prepared to invest $300 mln in Venezuela, beginning with a $100 mln inversion investment.The minister also listed Poland, Denmark, Honduras, Norway, and Vietnam as foreign countries that would be willing to receive petro in exchange for food and medicine, citing a total amount of $435 mln. According to Mora, Canada has also expressed interest in investing in Venezuela in the sphere of “pharmaceutics for humans and animals.”The petro is an ERC20 token that has been pre-mined on the Ethereum Blockchain, with each petro is backed by one barrel of oil. Maduro had ordered the issuance of 100 mln in petro on Jan. 14 in preparation for the pre-sale.The creation of the petro has been viewed skeptically by critics and members of the Venezuelan opposition parliament who consider the petro a fraudulent currency that could help Maduro avoid sanctions.The petro’s pre-sale will take place from Feb. 20 at -04:00 UTC to Mar. 19 at -04:00 UTC, and there will be 38.4 mln tokens available. Pre-sale tokens “may be exchanged for petro [coins] at any time between the launch date and the closing of the initial offer,” according to the white paper.The ICO will take place a day after the end of the pre-sale, Mar. 20 at -04:00 GMT, with 44 mln petro available for sale at a reference selling point of $60 - the price of a barrel of oil in Venezuela in the second week of Jan. 2018.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.Bitcoin and its crypto brethren received an unlikely lifeline from American trading regulators on Tuesday this week, which ended in a complete turnaround after a nasty market crash.The Commodities and Future Trading Commission and the US Securities Exchange Commission held a highly anticipated hearing on Tuesday, focused on their stance towards cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings and Blockchain technology.The discourse came at a crucial juncture, as the overall cryptocurrency market endured a spiraling sell off which saw Bitcoin reach lows below $7,000, a figure not seen in over five months.Industry experts and pundits took to social media platforms, posting updates from the hearing which saw CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo and SEC Chair Jay Clayton make some highly influential statements about the current stance towards the overall cryptocurrency and Blockchain space.With a prevailing sentiment of fear, uncertainty and doubt, a negative stance from the two bodies that hold the future of mainstream cryptocurrency trade could have been as good as a death knell.But both bodies unveiled balanced and positive sentiments towards cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology.Giancarlo delivered an upbeat address saying “if there was no Bitcoin, there would be no distributed ledger technology,”  when he was asked about the value of Bitcoin.He also made it clear in his written testimony that cryptocurrencies are here to say and that regulation needs to nurture the sector while protecting investors.“Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response. The evolution of these assets, their volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious examination.”Clayton echoed the sentiments of the CFTC chair, but he also produced a discourse that gave credit to the cryptocurrency industry for adding a new paradigm to the financial system:“Distributed ledger and other emerging technologies have the potential to further influence and improve the capital markets and the financial services industry.”Clayton also hammered home the importance of fair regulatory frameworks that will create an environment that benefits all parties involved.“Said simply, we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and markets.”Markets react favorablyThe overarching reaction following the hearing has had a positive effect on the cryptocurrency markets.Bitcoin and Ethereum had seen 20 percent growth in value, according to CoinMarketCap data, at the time of writing, and the rest of the cryptocurrency market was in the green.This latest development has provided the first bit of positive sentiment in over a fortnight. China has reiterated it’s zero-tolerance of cryptocurrency, India’s regulatory stance has been taken badly, and a number of mainstream banks have ruled out cryptocurrency purchases with credit cards.These developments culminated in a highly volatile, selling-spree in the cryptocurrency market.But, with regulatory bodies like the CFTC and SEC promising to foster environments conducive to the growth and development of legitimate cryptocurrencies, fears have been allayed.What remains to be seen is if this is the start of a fresh wave of positive growth in value for the cryptocurrency space.The developments have had a number of high profile pundits posting upbeat predictions in response.Canadian Twitter user Armin van Bitcoin said that the Mayer Multiple is signaling a strong buy signal for Bitcoin:Software engineer Pierre Rochard quoted Xapo CEO Wences Casares in a tweet that emphasized patience in the world of cryptocurrencies.Business Insider’s Frank Chaparro shared a story on the Winklevoss twins, who have released bullish sentiments on Bitcoin following the SEC and CFTC hearing this week.",37208

This number comes from a comparison to the $7 trln global gold market, which the brothers claim Bitcoin will disrupt.According to CNBC, the Winklevoss brothers were looking at a period of 10 to 20 years in their prediction.In response to the recent criticisms of cryptocurrencies by representatives of J.P. Morgan and the officials present at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Tyler Winklevoss argued that digital currencies will be a great instrument of machine-to-machine transactions.“Cryptocurrencies aren't really important for human-to-human transactions ... but when machines-to-machines trade economic value, they are going to plug into protocols like bitcoin and ethereum. They are not going to open bank accounts at J.P. Morgan ... those were invented by bankers before the internet existed,"" Tyler stated, adding that ""the criticisms are just a failure of the imagination.""Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported on a number of experts who shared a similarly bullish outlook on the price of Bitcoin, predicting that it will reach $50,000 by the end of 2018, resulting in a total cryptocurrency market cap of $1 trillion.",56074

Equally, more experienced traders want to continue to advance their portfolios to their best potential. A new ‘all in one’ platform, Pinnacle, aims to provide an investment multiplex for traders of all levels.The company works under the belief that ‘Every single person can become a successful trader as long as they use the right tools and choose the trading style that fits their strengths and weaknesses.’ Their white paper outlines how the platform will provide access to ‘every major trading exchange worldwide’ from PC, Mac, Android and iOS, with fully automated arbitrage trading between each of these exchanges. There will be a YamaCat trading course for novice investors and features which allow traders of all levels to track and/or mimic professional traders across multiple platforms. A charting app will allow users to view the progress of multiple exchanges at a glance, and highly accurate (80%+) Pinnacle propriety trading signals can guide investors towards decisions across these exchanges. Pinnacle believe that these features and more will ‘will revolutionize trading cryptocurrency and world markets.’Pinnacle will also feature a Stellar based token, Brilliance (BRIL), which it describes as ‘the backbone of Pinnacle.’ Users will require a balance of BRIL in order to access the numerous features within Pinnacle, which the company say will ensure the tokens see ‘a consistent increase in value and price.’ With 3.5 second block times, users can execute trades exceptionally quickly using BRIL.Pinnacle is looking to implement these plans rapidly. Already partnered with companies such as LDJ Capital, FXCM and Ameritrade, they aim to release some trading bots for BRIL holders to use within the first quarter of 2018. Their ICO is already live until Feb. 25th (token supply 26,990,000 $1/token), after which they plan for BRIL to be listed on at least three crypto exchanges. In addition, they plan to hold interesting PR activities such as a ‘trading contest’ in Q3; the ‘best trader on Twitter’ will win a $1 mln prize.Project leader Roman Guelfi-Gibbs has been trading since the age of 16 and has clearly brought his decades of the experience to the fore when guiding Pinnacle to become the first single-access point for crypto exchange in history. He is advised by Blockchain advocate David Drake, who’s investments are looked after by over 50 global directors. This is a truly formidable team who look set to live up to their claims of ‘revolutionizing the world of crypto.’Should the platform launch continue to prove successful, Pinnacle looks set to open up the world of crypto to even more users than before, providing all training, strategies, advice, statistics and trading platforms required for novices to get started and professionals to increase their assets. It will be interesting to see if they can achieve their aim of becoming ‘THE ONE application that traders need to perform all aspects of trading,’ and how this will affect other single-function platforms.Katharine Sharpe Disclaimer.

He sees a turn to crypto as a way for the city of Berkeley to resist the current presidential administration, telling Business Insider:""Berkeley is the center of the resistance, and for the resistance to work, it must have a coin.""Berkeley is a sanctuary city, meaning that it doesn’t cooperate with the federal government to enforce immigration law. The Trump administration has recently been escalating the fight against the existence of sanctuary cities as part of their immigration reform.Last year, Trump had also tweeted a threat to pull federal funding from UC Berkeley, a university located in the city, after student protests led to the cancellation of conservative Milo Yiannopoulos's scheduled speech:If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017The ICO could also be a way for the city to help the increasing homeless population, regardless of whether federal funding is ever cut. Bartlett said:""We have a jobs explosion and a super tight housing crunch. You're looking at a disaster. We thought we'd pull together the experts and find a way to finance [affordable housing] ourselves.""The tokens would be backed by municipal bonds, which governments normally issue when they need to raise funding.

30,282,"Yves Mersch, Executive Board member of the European Central Bank (ECB), referred to cryptocurrencies as a risk of “contagion and contamination of the existing financial system” during an interview with 4 Technology on Feb. 8.Both the traditional and crypto markets fell sharply at the beginning of this week, prompting responses from shaken financial institutions like the wave of banks banning credit cards for crypto purchases.Mersch warned of the potential for crypto markets to begin more strongly influencing traditional markets as the two have become more interconnected:“If you increasingly have bridges between the virtual world and the real world and then there is a collapse in this virtual world, it could drain liquidity from the real world. This then becomes a concern for the central bank.”During the Bloomberg interview, Mersch recommended that regulatory options should be looked into even before the upcoming March G20 summit in Argentina, where crypto regulation is expected to be high on the agenda,“For me, one obligation would already be to force the unregulated platforms to report transactions in a harmonized way to repositories so that we would have access to information -- also in order to create a better response.”Mersch adds that ECB is also concerned about the “social and psychological effect” that cryptocurrencies “seem to have.”On Feb. 6, general manager of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Augustín Carstens similarly voiced concerns about the increasing integration between cryptocurrencies and traditional finance. Carstens called Bitcoin a “Ponzi scheme” and warned of a “threat to financial stability” if cryptocurrencies became more connected to the global financial system.Mersch told Bloomberg that the European Central Bank fully agrees with Carstens concern:“You won’t be surprised to know that we at the ECB are fully in line with his views and we have similar worries, or similar endeavors we are working on.”Just yesterday in an interview with CNBC, ECB’s Chair of the Supervisory Board Daniele Nouy said that future involvement of ECB-regulated banks in crypto regulation was “very very low,” and the crypto regulation for ECB itself was “not exactly very high on its to-do list.”",26243

Only if this is remedied quickly at German and at EU level this technology can gain an enduring foothold in Europe.”Germany has been broadly slow to develop a significant, robust approach to the emerging Blockchain phenomenon, placing it at odds with neighboring Switzerland in particular.The Bundesverband has been developed as a direct solution to the lack of progress, stating its mission to propagate “decentralized infrastructure” during its founding at the German parliament in June 2017.As well as highlighting areas the government is now keen to address in terms of regulation, the report also notes what still needs to appear for Blockchain to be a success in the German economy.“What is missing? Sandboxing possibilities have to be created especially for the dynamic blockchain area, so that new ideas can be tried out without artificial obstacles,” it continues.“Only the experiences that arise from those sandboxes can point to future regulatory needs.

All this content is created for free by millions of people because they want to share their experience with their friends, colleagues or even the whole world. But it doesn’t occur to them that they are creating value and don’t get any reward for it. That’s exactly what TravelChain is built for: to change this whole experience for the better.However, fellow travelers are not the only ones to benefit from the platform. The small and medium-sized business can cut their costs in half, improve and target their offer and grow in leaps by using the data that the users are willing to sell.Ilya explains how that works “Traveler Passport” is a key component of TravelChain functioning. It is a model with distributed trust which allows you to form an image of another person without being acquainted personally.” The idea is to collect such profiles called “passports” by motivating travelers  to share their information in exchange for a reward. Users get travel tokens for sharing the info such as preferences (in food or entertainment, for example), location, the way of living and traveling, etc. The question which appears in minds “who needs this data and how it will be used?”Orlov clarifies that the primary consumers of this information are travel businesses, also using the TravelСhain platform. These companies will buy potential customers data with travel tokens, and travelers, at their end, will get travel tokens as a reward. Here is the explanation of how it works with a real example: “For instance, say you have a vegetarian restaurant, thanks to TravelChain you´ll find out that there are 150 vegetarians currently living in the neighborhood. You can purchase the more specific data like their tastes and preferences in exchange for Travel Tokens. Once you get the information, the users will receive the tokens as a reward.” According to Orlov, data is a private issue. Travellers might be hesitant to share their personal information with the third party. He believes the user is to decide which information they are ready to share and with which categories of he fellow platform members. Besides, once shared, the personal data will be as safe as it could be using Blockchain.The road aheadOrlov says, Blockchain universe evolves within the travel sector, TravelChain makes it possible to integrate new products and services without excessive investment costs or overly complicated implementation efforts. “We have ambitious plans for 2018. The key point is that we do not compete with anyone, we are striving to make the market and services better by integrating the industry.” Currently one of the top priorities for TravelChain is to integrate with travel businesses. As of now, they have an agreement with IZI.Travel, tourister.ru, tvil.ru, more agreements are under discussion and soon to be announced.  Another step in the list is their aim to is the integration with EOS.io Infrastructure for Decentralized Applications. TravelChain is planning to allocate smart contracts for the most apps within the Travel Chain platform on EOS.To summarize, Orlov explained his view on humanity future through Blockchain development: “Blockchain platforms like TravelChain could completely change the landscape of the travel market with users taking an active part in creating value, communicating and sharing data directly avoiding intermediaries and aggregators.”",31485
34,246,"India is “aggressively pursuing” cryptocurrency holders for tax this week, claim mainstream media outlets such as Financial Times and Quartz, despite the policy being in place since December 2017.In a repeat round of misinterpretation of facts surrounding the Indian government’s treatment of cryptocurrency, multiple publications warn that 100,000 investors who “skipped paying taxes” have received letters demanding what they owe.That number “may rise up to 500,000,” Quartz adds.India has been a focus for Bitcoin traders this month after a budget speech by finance minister Arun Jaitley provoked price volatility due to press sources erroneously announcing the country would “ban” Bitcoin.While local businesses such as exchanges decried the headlines as “FUD,” the effect on markets remained palpable.The issue of tax appears little different. Local news outlet Press Trust of India (PTI) originally reported on plans to target “400,000 - 500,000” exchange users for tax payments back in December.The 100,000 letters causing a storm this week appear simply to be the first step in a pre-agreed plan, with no new developments beyond comments from Central Board of Direct Taxes chairman Sushil Chandra.“We found out that there is no clarity on investments made by many people, which means they have not declared it properly… we have informed all the (director generals of income tax) across India. They are issuing notices and so that would be taxed,” Chandra confirmed February 6.The so-called “aggression” on behalf of regulators, according to PTI, further impacts only high-net worth individuals using exchanges - roughly 25% of the total user base.",26080

Expert Takes cover everything from Blockchain technology and ICO funding to taxation, regulation and cryptocurrency adoption by different sectors of the economy.If you would like to contribute an Expert Take, please email your ideas and CV to a.mcqueen@cointelegraph.com.The mainstream media has become obsessed with the crypto frenzy with the main focus on Bitcoin price. By treating cryptocurrencies like any other asset class or just as a fad, journalists are missing the elephant in the room: investment banks are about to be disrupted big time.More than 1,500 cryptocurrencies alreadyThese days it is much easier to raise funds through an ICO than through traditional venture capital funds. As a result, there are already more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies out there. Just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable for a small company with just a handful of employees to raise millions of dollars on the back of a simple white paper. Now, startups can do it with just an exciting concept and a white paper of a few dozen pages (sometimes less). Thanks to the ERC20 standard that uses the existing Ethereum Blockchain, anyone can launch a token at a limited cost without having to worry about building a Blockchain infrastructure from scratch.Obviously,  Ethereum can be taken by another, more advanced platform. But for now, it makes more than 80 percent of the market. Out of the 580 tokens out there, 475 are on the Ethereum Blockchain.Source: Coinmarketcap.com, February 2, 2018The genius of the Ethereum Blockchain was making fundraising so incredibly easy: all you have to do is create a smart contract to do an ICO. Every time ETH (Ethereum tokens) are sent to the contract address, the contract issues newly minted tokens that are automatically sent back to the sender. Wall Street should be terrified because Ethereum has just made investment banks redundant.Book building (the process of lining up investors to buy security to be issued) has historically been very juicy for Wall Street, and investment banks acted as intermediaries between asset managers and companies or governments wishing to raise debt (bond offerings) or equity (IPOs). Until recently there was no way to bypass them. Now there is. Banks have not started feeling the pain yet, but venture capitalists have. Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see them in the list of pre-ICO investors (see the upcoming Telegram ICO). VCs have to adapt or be history, and Wall Street is next.Source: Coinmarketcap.com, February 2, 2018Beyond UberizationInitially, I entitled this post “The Uberization of Wall Street,”  but then realized that what Uber is doing is what banks are already doing: connecting supply (of capital) with demand (investors) and taking a hefty fee in the middle. Uber simply disrupted a sector that had not evolved ever since it had been invented where supply and demand were just incredibly inefficiently connected. Banks are already connecting supply and demand, but with the Blockchain technology, they are not needed anymore, at least not for what they are doing now.How Ethereum can disrupt the bond marketLet’s have a look at one of the most lucrative businesses on Wall Street: the issuance of corporate bonds. Last year, companies around the world issued more than $3.5 tln worth of bonds. The way this currently works is the following: a company mandates an investment bank that is going to sell the bond to be issued to pension funds and asset managers. Investment banks control this market because they have access to these funds managers. But as ICOs have successfully demonstrated, you do not need such intermediaries anymore, and companies could reach investors directly by issuing smart bonds. How could this work in practice?The issuanceCompany V creates a smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain that replicates how a bond works (i.e., payment of coupons semi-annually and repayment of principal at maturity).Investors who wish to participate in the IBO (Initial Bond Offering) send ETH to the contract address and specify the lowest coupon they are willing to receive.Once the IBO is over, the smart contract automatically builds the order book with investors willing to accept the lowest coupon first, the marginal investor needed to fill the order book sets the coupon for a bond.All the investors who did not make it to the final order book automatically get back the ETH they had sent to the smart contract.Debt servicingEvery six months, investors receive the coupon (interest) as set in the original smart contract.If company V does not want to take the risk that the value of Ethereum increases substantially, payments can be made in ETH but adjusted with the exchange rate of Ethereum with the fiat currency of the bond. Before payment of the coupon, the smart contract will get the exchange rate between the fiat currency and Ethereum from an oracle (data provider) and pay the right amount of ETH such that the bond replicates precisely how a fiat currency bond would have behaved.Alternatively, payments of coupons and repayment of principal can be made directly in tokens backed by fiat currency and redeemable with a reputable, audited financial institution.    2. At maturity of the bond, the smart contract pays out both the coupon and the principal (either the same amount of ETH or the same amount of US dollar paid in Ether or fiat-backed tokens).How many human actions were required to run all this process? Zero. The only thing that needs to be done is to write the smart contract. But just like with the ERC20 standard, you can expect standardized smart bond contracts to be available soon. A well reviewed and audited smart bond contract would mitigate the risk of bugs in the smart contract.Huge potential for smart bondsThe way the bond market currently works keeps many investors out. Buying a single piece of a bond often requires from $5,000 to $200,000. Hence, many investors are left with no choice but to buy mutual funds or ETFs that include a basket of bonds. With a smart bond, anyone could invest as little as $10 and get a piece of the bond. Diaspora investors who want to invest in their home countries will be able to do so, small and medium enterprises will have access to new financing options beyond what commercial banks can offer them and micro-bonds could also be issued, all at close to zero cost. ICOs were just the beginning, the real disruption of financial markets is yet to come.Disclaimer: The views and interpretations in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.com and the World Bank.Vincent Launay is a finance specialist at the World Bank in Washington DC.

36,582,"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.After the clampdown in China and South Korea to cryptocurrency trading, there were fears that the US will also follow suit.However, the testimony of Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has allayed these fears.They were much more realistic and supportive of cryptocurrencies than what the market had expected. As a result, most cryptocurrencies are currently in a sharp pullback, after days of weakness.Even after the recent plunge, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrencies will enter into a strong bull market that is forecast to be at least as strong as 2017.Let’s see if we can find signs of bullishness in the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.BTC/USDWe had previously recommended buying Bitcoin in the range of $5,500 to $5,800 on panic selling. It came close to our buy level, but did not reach there. It bottomed out on February 6 at $6,075.04.  The cryptocurrency is finding buyers at lower levels who are using the sharp plunge in prices to buy for the long-term.So, is the downtrend over or will the market resume its fall after a short pullback?During a strong downtrend, a 1 to 3-day pullback can be expected. The counter-trend move usually faces selling at the 20-day EMA or at previous supports, which now act as resistance.The BTC/USD pair is likely to face resistance at $9,500, which was the high on February 3. Above this, a move to $9,920 can’t be ruled out, but we expect the range of $9,920 to $10,700 to act as a strong resistance.We believe that the cryptocurrency will turn down from one of the above-mentioned levels. If the retest of the lows is successful, we may add long positions for the long-term.If the lows break, we’ll have to wait for a few more days.   ETH/USDIn our previous analysis, we expected a strong support at the $611.34 to $640 zone. Ethereum bottomed out at $565.54 on February 6.This pullback is likely to face resistance at the current levels. If the ETH/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line, we might see a rally towards the $967 levels, where both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA converge. We anticipate a turnaround from one of these levels.If the next downward trend takes support between $770 to $640, it will indicate a bottom. However, if the bears breakdown below $565, a fall to $390 can’t be ruled out, but we consider this unlikely.  BCH/USDBitcoin Cash bottomed out at $778.2021, just below the critical support of $854. However, the pullback from the lows does not instill confidence.    After the steep decline, we believe that the BCH/USD pair will enter a period of consolidation before embarking on an upward trend. The current pullback is likely to face resistance between $1150 and $1325 levels, from the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line.We should turn bullish in the long-term only on a sustained move above the downtrend line.XRP/USDRipple broke below its critical support of $0.61, but quickly recovered from $0.5627 levels. The pullback might face resistance at the previous support of $0.87.Above this, the XRP/USD pair will face a strong resistance at the downtrend line. We’ll look to buy if the downward trend finds support between $0.87 and $0.61 levels.XLM/USDStellar broke below the $0.296 critical support on February 6, but it did not fall to the support line of the descending channel.Similar to the other cryptocurrencies, the XLM/USD pair is currently in a pullback, which will probably  face resistance at $0.41; this level was previously acting as strong support.We may have a positive outlook on Stellar once it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel.LTC/USDWe mentioned in our previous analysis that the recovery in Litecoin was stronger than other cryptocurrencies. While the other cryptocurrencies broke to new lows on February 6, the LTC/USD pair held on to its February 2 lows, which is a sign of strength.If the recovery breaks out of $175, it will indicate a double bottom in the short-term, which gives it an upside target objective of $243.At the same time, the cryptocurrency has a slew of overhead resistances between $168 and $185. Hence, we anticipate a few days of range bound action between $107 and $175.We recommend looking to buy once the pair moves above $185.  XEM/USDNEM fell to a low of $0.36476 on February 6, close to the critical support of $0.31672.Currently, it is close to the downtrend line, which will probably offer strong resistance. The downtrend will be over once the XEM/USD pair sustains above the downtrend line. We recommend waiting for a buy setup to form before making any purchases.NEO/USDWe had forecast NEO to fall to $64.83 levels in our previous analysis and on February 6, it bottomed out at $63.62.NEO has seen one of the sharpest pullbacks among the top cryptocurrencies. Still, it can face resistance between $111 and $123, from the moving averages.We’d better wait for the NEO/USD pair to hold above the $93 levels in the next leg down to start purchasing it.EOS/USDWe had forecast that the $6.5 to $7.4 zone will act as strong support, and on February 6, EOS bottomed out at $5.7917.Right now it is trading inside a tight descending channel. If it breaks out of the resistance line of the channel, it’ll possibly rally to the $10.7 levels, where both moving averages converge.If the EOS/USD pair holds above $7.5 levels in the next fall, we may place purchase orders.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange; the charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.",166555
37,446,"Researchers from Chinese Cybersecurity company 360Netlab has discovered a new Android-based cryptocurrency mining malware that infects vulnerable Android devices to mine cryptocurrency, as reported in a blog post from the firm on Feb. 6. As 360Netlab reports, the ADB.Miner worm scans can affect any kind of Android device, including smartphones, tablets, and television sets. The malware infects the device to mine Monero (XMR) coins and sends all acquired funds to a single wallet. According to 360Netlab’s blog post, the cryptocurrency mining worm ADB.Miner has been actively infecting devices since Feb. 5, managing to infiltrate 7,000 Android devices, mainly in China and South Korea. The researchers emphasize that the ADB.Miner’s spreading speed is high, the number of scanned devices doubling every 12 hours. The malware is being spread using the publicly accessible Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on an opened port 5555, which is normally closed. At the current stage of the research, the the security specialists claim that they “have no idea about how and when this port was opened”.Last week Cointelegraph reported about another case of malware mining Monero, the Smorinru botnet, which has managed to mine over 9,000 Monero coins since May 2017.

38,383,"Blockchain technology is the underlying framework upon which most cryptocurrencies operate and it has become one of the most important technological advances in the 21st century.Simply put, a Blockchain is a secure system that stores information. This is typically done in individual blocks which are encrypted, together forming a chain of secure data.Bitcoin’s Blockchain pioneered the technology as a transactional system. Its Blockchain is an electronic accounting ledger, with each block holding a finite amount of transactions made with the cryptocurrency. It is completely decentralized, with transactions verified by a worldwide network of miners.Here is where the issue of energy enters the picture. The truth is, cryptocurrency mining uses a lot of energy. That has put a spotlight on mainstream power production, which is mostly unclean and unsustainable.This has led to a new wave of Blockchain technology that looks to provide applications and innovations to the way we use energy and how we go about providing efficient data and transaction systems in the sector.By the numbersAccording to a research done by the event and consulting company Solarplaza, of the 90 companies included in its analysis, over 50 percent of Blockchain projects working within the energy space are based in Europe. The top three countries include the US, Germany and the Netherlands.Peer to peer trading projects account for the most use cases, while around 50 percent of these projects are using the Ethereum Blockchain.As an indicator of just how new this movement is, over 70 percent of these projects were formed between 2016 and 2017 - and one in four of the projects are planning an initial coin offering or token sale.P2P, utility, cryptocurrency, platforms, E-VehiclesThe majority of these companies have peer-to-peer Blockchain systems that offer a plethora of industry related services.A number of projects are offering decentralized energy trading services. The likes of LO3 Energy, which developed the Brooklyn Microgrid which enables the community to buy energy through the platform. Producers of solar energy can sell excess green energy to other consumers connected on the platform.This is just one example of a multitude of ground-breaking offerings by companies providing platforms for people, businesses and industries to trade energy. It’s interesting to note energy giants BP, Shell and Statoil are part of a consortium developing an in-house Blockchain platform form energy commodities trade.Blockchain technology is also reforming energy utilities functions.A number of companies have pioneered Blockchain platforms. WEF award winners Electron set up platforms for energy meters, from user registrations to meter data privacy. A number of other utility-based projects are offering customers platforms that track energy consumption and provide cheaper energy prices available on the grid.This includes the likes of IBM, who teamed up with TenneT to create a pilot platform using Blockchain technology to balance supply and demand of electricity to ensure a supply of electricity.Of course, a number of cryptocurrencies have been created to facilitate energy trading platforms. A straightforward use case is Spectral energy’s Juliette coin, which is used by residents in an Amsterdam community to pay for electricity.ElectriCChain has created SolarCoin, which is a reward-based cryptocurrency for a network of affiliated solar power generators. For every MWh of electricity produced, you get one SolarCoin, which is roughly worth $0.50.A number of online energy platforms will also be present at the conference in Amsterdam. Many of these platforms offer global networks to create better communication between energy producers.They also offer a variety of applications that allow the industry to monitor energy production and consumption - for consumers and producers. There are platforms that offer supply chain solutions for energy commodities like oil and gas. Some offer platforms for consumers to browse the cheapest available energy options available in their country.Four projects in the report are directly aimed at the electric vehicle industry using Blockchain to help users manage and pay for charging stations and more specific needs like car sharing and rental.To top it off a number of projects are providing people with cutting-edge opportunities thanks to Blockchain technology. The Sun Exchange is an example of this. The project enables people to own solar panels in ideal locations around the world. The panels are then leased out, with the owners paid income in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Blockchain2BusinessWhile the list of energy projects involved into Blockchain becomes too long to list in one article, people that have a keen interest in Blockchain projects reforming the way we look at energy have now an interesting platform to participate in.In order to unite energy companies and Blockchain solutions providers, this February, Solarplaza organized its first Blockchain2Business conference in Amsterdam. A host of Blockchain companies that are pioneering the sector, from energy production to tokenization of energy, was brought together, as well as those who want to know more about opportunities offered by Blockchain.",38153
39,560,"This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.It has been a sobering couple of days for the whole cryptocurrency market after the biggest sell off in recent memory.Bitcoin dipped below $7,000 for the first time since November marking a complete turnaround from the value that marked the start of a phenomenal bull run all the way up to $20,000.But after positive statements from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Tuesday, the markets have had a complete turnaround.In the space of a week, the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization (according to Coinmarketcap data) had dropped to $276.8 bln, losing over $100 bln in value in that timeframe before seeing gains of over $100 bln today.Last week was marked by panic in the crypto market, no doubt from late investors that piled money into the markets amid the rapidly rising Bitcoin price late last year.As a swathe of regulatory moves from governments and banks around the world caused uncertainty, people scrambled to sell in an effort to minimize losses.On paper, it looked bad. But the cryptocurrency pull back has ironically overshadowed a far bigger stock market over the past week.Crypto crash overshadowing massive stock market crashCoinciding with the massive correction taking place in the cryptocurrency world, the global stock market has also been hit by a massive crash.According to Reuters, the past week has seen over $4 tln of stock value has been wiped out.Take a moment to reflect on that number. Global stock markets lost nearly 15 times the total cryptocurrency market capitalization in the space of seven days.The cryptocurrency sell off, which has seen a $200 bln drop in value over the past two weeks, is not to be taken lightly but the scale of the sell-off affecting mainstream stock markets reminds us that cryptocurrencies have a long way to go in the grand scheme of things.The global stock market crash is being attributed to high bond yields in the US for 2017, which led to fears of looming interest rate hikes and inflation.Clarity through the FUDA number of factors have influenced the cryptocurrency correction over the past two weeks. A number of big banks have banned the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, which naturally caused many of these buyers to exit the market to consolidate losses.Coupled with an all-out crackdown from China and some misleading interpretations of the Indian government’s stance on cryptocurrencies has made the markets very uneasy. This has led to a spiral of selling, which seems to have cooled somewhat late on Tuesday, Feb. 6.24 hours later, cryptocurrencies have recovered across the board. The SEC and CFTC can take credit after their positive comments on the future of cryptocurrencies.In the wake of the market recovery, industry experts have now offered some fresh, optimistic predictions of highs in 2018.",45033

41,641,"Forbes, known for its “World’s Billionaires List”, published a list of the richest people in cryptocurrency for the first time, Tuesday Feb. 6.The goal of publishing such a list, according to Forbes Editor Randall Lane, is to“[provide] a snapshot of a pivotal moment, part of the transparency needed to pull crypto away from its provenance as the favorite currency of drug dealers and into the adolescence of a legitimate asset class.”While compiling a list of the world’s traditional billionaires is a relatively straightforward task, calculating the exact amount of wealth of the world’s richest crypto tycoons is more difficult.Cryptocurrencies are by definition a decentralized, encrypted payment system that began outside of the traditional global financial system. The “newly minted crypto rich,” as described by Forbes staff writer Jeff Kauflin, “live in a strange milieu that blends paranoid secrecy with ostentatious display.”The Forbes “Richest People in Cryptocurrency” list is broken up into five categories: “idealists, builders, opportunists, infrastructure players and establishment investors.” In order to make the Forbes list, one must have accrued over $350 million.Instead of static numbers, the net worths of the people on the list are listed in ranges, calculated based on the “estimated holdings of cryptocurrencies (a few provided proof), post-tax profits from trading crypto-assets and stakes in crypto-related businesses.”Forbes acknowledges that they could have left some people off the list and that their estimates may be “wide of the mark.”The list contains 19 people. One can click on each member of the list on Forbes’s website in order to see a short bio and an estimated crypto net worth.Other data was published along with the list, like the average age of crypto’s richest compared to the age of Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans (42 vs. 67), and the average daily price volatility in January 2018 for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) compared to Apple, Proctor & Gamble, and gold.When creating the list, Lane spoke with Joe Lubin, the founder of Consensys, about other crypto tycoons’ potential concerns about releasing such data. Lubin, who Lane referred to as the “statesman of cryptocurrency”, said that he and his peers weren’t looking for public attention. Lubin also questioned how Forbes could arrive at any accurate numbers, and brought up the issues of potentially targeting these people for theft. However, Lane adds that Lubin and his “crypto elite” peers did recognize the list’s importance.Kauflin writes that Forbes,“firmly believe we made the world a better place by shining a light on the invisible rich. Just as crypto has evolved from the days of the Silk Road drug site and the Mt. Gox digital hijacking, fortunes of this magnitude should never be allowed to lurk in the shadows.”CryptoWeekly, a cryptocurrency newsletter, released a comparable list of the top 100 most influential people in the crypto community. Their list is factored not by net worth, but by the research and technological contributions a person has made in the world of crypto.Among those who were left out of Forbes’ richest in crypto rankings, but included in the CryptoWeekly influential list, are important crypto players like Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, and crypto pioneer Nick Szabo, among others.",83919
42,542,"There is little doubting why, in the run up to Bitcoin all time high of $20,000, people were entering the cryptocurrency market. There was a promise of massive growth, potentially huge returns on investment, and a story already told of missing out as an early adopter.People thus flooded the market, entering for all the wrong reasons, really. However, this created a massive spike in interest and a massive spike in price. Things have changed somewhat now, with Bitcoin heading towards $6,000 rather than above $20,000, and this has caused a huge sell off as investors now flood out of the market. But what reasons remain today for people to buy Bitcoin?Get in for the right reasonsThe issue was, with this massive spike in interest, that people were throwing money at something they did not understand in the hopes of making a profit. It sounds familiar because it happened before.The dotcom boom has predicated around similar happenings. People jumped on the bandwagon, not knowing why, and built a huge market on a flimsy base. Those who are not so technologically inclined may have shunned understanding Bitcoin as a new wave of technology, and used that as an excuse. But then still, as investors, they should at least be savvy with their assets.Bitcoin is a bad assetIn comparison to stocks and bonds, Bitcoin does not hold much water as a good investment asset, especially when considering long-term capital appreciation. True, Bitcoin has increased its value substantially over time, but it lacks a few other facets.In stocks, an investor stakes a claim in the company's net assets, and as the value of the company rises over time, so does the equity. In bonds, individuals essentially loan the company money in return for an agreed upon stream of interest income.Thus, both these options provide future profits and future income and tick the boxes of sound investments. Bitcoin cannot be counted in the same breath as stock and bonds. Having one Bitcoin today does not entitle you to more Bitcoins in the future, nor does it offer the promise of any future cash flow.Look at the technologyBut in any case Bitcoin shines as a technology. Those who are trying to separate Bitcoin and Blockchain are wrong in doing so, but their premise is right; Bitcoin should be heralded for its potential as a technology.Its use as a decentralized system of money which liberates users from the tyranny and hegemony of the banking system allows for seamless cross-border transfers and disrupts the financial system - these are reasons to celebrate and back Bitcoin.Hopefully this is a dotcom bubble popBitcoin has been likened to the dotcom bubble burst a number of times, and there is probably merit in it. In the dotcom situation, a technology was being used as an investment opportunity as people rushed in to be a part of the bandwagon.That foundation of uninformed get rich quick types in the dotcom boom caused the technology to be almost forgotten about as companies changed their names and did all they could to cash in, including buying with debt.All of these signs have repeated themselves in Bitcoin, and perhaps it is the best thing for it. Those who got into the space for the wrong reasons have quickly gotten out of it. And those who remain, are true to the potential and vision it still has.Should I buy Bitcoin today?As old as the adage is, it is worth repeating and highlighting: ‘Don’t buy Bitcoin to become an overnight millionaire.’ The reason this needs to be said again is because it will end badly for the individual and for the currency.If like the Internet and all its associated powers today, you believe Bitcoin can change the world, then it is worth buying into today - while it is cheap. If, you are out to make a quick buck, leave this space alone.Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

Once, it was the center of the cryptocurrency universe, until it got too big for its boots and starting drawing attention from the controlling government.The bans came, first for ICOs then for exchanges, yet, this only slowed rather than stopped the growth of Bitcoin in general, and cryptocurrencies as a whole, in the People’s Republic. The idea was to stamp out Bitcoin and its affiliates as the Chinese government took exception to this freedom of money and the movement of it over the borders. However, even though these bans were unprecedented and harsh, they never really laid the killing blow.Total BlackoutThe idea is now that the Chinese government will shut the last door on crypto activity in the state with this ban on trading with a foreign platform through a massive firewall. This move comes only because the regulators had to admit that their previous bans were ineffective.This is another step towards Bitcoin blackout in China, with their state-owned social media and search engines wiping clean any trace of cryptocurrency and ICO advertising in the past few days. This is in line with Facebook’s decision to do the same.Will it work?Regulation of the cryptocurrency space has been a very divided subject for a lot of nations who have been forced into action by its monumental growth. Mostly it is a case by case scenario where different nations choose their level of control; Japan has accepted the currency and is playing a wait-and-see game, while China is trying to lead the way in terms of stern action.In an article which was recounted by the South China Morning Post, it explained the reasoning for this latest move. The article acknowledged that recent attempts to stamp out digital currencies by shutting down domestic exchanges had failed to completely eradicate trading:“ICOs and virtual currency trading did not completely withdraw from China following the official ban … after the closure of the domestic virtual currency exchanges, many people turned to overseas platforms to continue participating in virtual currency transactions...Overseas transactions and regulatory evasion have resumed … risks are still there, fueled by illegal issuance, and even fraud and pyramid selling.”Dangerous gameThis is the Chinese government’s last shot at stamping out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, something that will be eagerly watched by many regulators in terms of a possible avenue to follow. However, should it fail and Bitcoin find another way to function in a society that has become accustomed and ingrained with it, then the regulators will take a big hit in their hard-nosed approach.This could actually be a defining moment for regulation that will either lead to blanket bans popping up all over or it could force the governments to come off their high horses and accept and integrate Bitcoin and others.",55807
44,866,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has moderated its stance on cryptocurrency regulation Wednesday, Feb. 7, describing it as “not exactly very high on its to-do list” in a brief interview with CNBC.The ECB’s Chair of the Supervisory Board Daniele Nouy added that although she had “no clue” whether new regulatory moves on crypto would come from Europe in the future, involvement of ECB-regulated banks in the sphere was “very, very low”.“We scrutinize the issue in a regulatory perspective, we are ready to do something if it was needed, but so far it's not exactly very high on our to-do list,” she told the network.The comment come ahead of an increasingly-anticipated G20 Summit this coming March in Argentina, where cryptocurrency regulation will form a major topic of discussion, according to a growing number of sources, including the ECB.During last month’s World Economic Forum (WEF), board member Benoit Coeure said he “expected” the international community to “focus very much on” the issue at the upcoming event in Buenos Aires.Despite the calls for an international regulatory effort on crypto spearheaded notably by French economy minister Bruno Le Maire in December, Europe’s umbrella bureaucracy appears less interested in direct intervention of its own.“We are not observing a systematically relevant holding of digital currencies by supervised institutions,” ECB president Mario Draghi told the European Parliament in Strasbourg Monday, quoted in various news outlets. Draghi added:“Actually, credit institutions... are showing limited appetite for digital currencies, like Bitcoin.”",31370
45,1867,"Following a volatile few days in the crypto markets this week, with Bitcoin (BTC) dipping below $7000 for the first time since November, 2017, several crypto experts have predicted an overall bull run. Experts told CNBC today, Feb. 7, that the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies could reach $1 trillion and that BTC itself could hit $50,000 by the end of this year.Jamie Burke, CEO at Outlier Ventures, Europe’s first Blockchain-based incubator, told CNBC that the predicted bull run will be followed by a general settling down of the market:""We believe after February the market will likely go on a bull run comparative if not greater than last year potentially reaching the trillion-dollar mark before a proper crypto winter sets in where the market becomes more focused on proper market fundamentals.”Thomas Glucksmann, head of APAC business at Gatecoin, sees regulation, the introduction of institutional capital, and technological advances like the Lightning Network as the main factors in rising cryptocurrency prices. He told CNBC over email:""There is no reason why we couldn't see bitcoin pushing $50,000 by December.""Back in April 2017 when BTC reached a former high of $1,300, Glucksmann had commented on the connection between the price jump and the start of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) month-long review of the Winklevoss twins Bitcoin ETF proposal.The joint SEC and The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) hearings held yesterday, Feb. 6, on their roles in the cryptocurrency sphere may have helped cause the market to see substantial rebound today, Feb. 7.Glucksmann also wrote that a possible element in market growth going forward could be the release of a cryptocurrency-based ETF, similar to when BTC’s price shot up to $16,800 in Dec. 2017 after the CBOE’s futures launch:""One possible appetizer for the bulls, or the catalyst for the recovery, will be the release of another cryptocurrency backed instrument listed on a major exchange. There are several candidates in the pipeline, it's only a matter of time until we have a cryptocurrency backed ETF (exchange-traded fund).""Utility tokens like IOTA, NEO, and Ethereum are also something to watch in the coming months, CEO of Hercules Tech Mick Sherman told NBC:""Utility tokens and assets with a working platform and a clear-cut reason for requiring both a blockchain and their own token, are more likely to appreciate in value this year. Some of these cryptoassets will not be used for years, meaning they have no utility value.”Ran Neuner, host of CNBC’s show CryptoTrader, has pinned his Feb. 1 tweet that predicted Bitcoin hitting $50,000 at the end of 2018:For the record, I am pinning this tweet.

46,294,"It might have started simple, printing small objects, but in the last couple of years, 3D printing technology has really outgrown itself. Now, it is both possible to 3D print tiny structures using living cells or print a whole house in 24 hours. The idea behind 3D manufacturing isn’t new, but 3D-TOKEN, a project of the Italian Politronica Srl startup wants to integrate it with Blockchain technology to create a ‘one of a kind’ glocal decentralized Just-In-Time Factory 4.0 matching the digital revolution of the 21st century.With steady growth, more than 278,000 desktops (under $5,000) 3D printers were available worldwide in 2015, according to the Wohlers Report 2016. The upcoming years will make these printers more and more affordable pointing towards a possible increase in demand. This is where the 3D-TOKENS project wants to tap in to create a Blockchain managed network hub of thousands of 3D-printers. The spin-off of the Italian University ""Politecnico di Torino,"" Politronica Srl wants to bring small to medium scale just-in-time digital manufacturing via the 3D-TOKENS project to a whole new level.Joining forces over BlockchainDubbed ‘Network Robots’ Workforce,’ this network will be able to change the traditional industry norms on time-to-market and product cost. Their Blockchain-based online platform will function as a facilitator between different innovative 3D manufacturing projects and could greatly reduce production cost. At the moment, the company maintains a network of 100 3D printers. Through the 3D-TOKENS project, they aim to increase this number to 3,000 by the end of 2019 with 1,000 Network Members and a production capacity of up to 300 tons of processed bioplastics.As of now, Politronica Srl has managed to stick a deal through its current network with such industry giants as the design shop chain Flying-Tiger Copenhagen (600 shops globally). Through this collaboration, they will roll out an innovative desktop 3D printing learning device and lamp called Q3D during the upcoming months.Multidimensional investmentThe 3D-TOKENS, hence the name, will also introduce its native cryptocurrency called 3DT based on the Ethereum Blockchain (their ICO ends on Feb. 11th). Users will be able to join crowdfunding campaigns, spend coins at their internal marketplace (like purchasing digital models for their own projects) or even trade 3DTs within the network at a fixed price revealed at the end of the ICO. And those holding into their 3DTs will also be able to receive profits’ share from the Network directly.However, people from the US and China won’t be able to purchase any coins due to various regulation, and even citizens or residents from Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada should check if they’re eligible before buying the non-refundable tokens.Printing out the futureThere is a growing interest incorporating the Blockchain technology into the 3D manufacturing world. It’s gradually being accepted, even the US Navy has considered making use of the secure data transfer Blockchain could provide to their 3D printing process. Various stages of the 3D printing process itself can benefit from the decentralized peculiarities of Blockchain distributing such tasks as the slicing stage among different users to ease on their computer’s capacity.If realized, the 3D-TOKEN network could accelerate the 3D printing market to its full potential. The company will start the expanding of the network in Northern Italy then to Europe and hopefully to a global level in the future.Until the ETH is back to $1,350, Politronica Srl offers a 50 percent bonus instead of 25 percent for every token purchase. Disclaimer.

During the hearing, CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo expressed optimism about Bitcoin with regard to the technology behind it, Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT):  “If there was no Bitcoin, there would be no DLT.”Cointelegraph correspondant Joseph Young tweeted this morning, Feb. 7, regarding the crypto market’s positive response to yesterday’s cryptocurrency hearing in the US:Yesterday, Feb. 6, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee tweeted about the overall volatility of the crypto markets and the benefits of staying bullish in the long-term, noting “Those that can withstand such a drop without flinching are the ones with lambos eventually.

48,337,"South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinpia has suspended fiat deposits as well as trading operations after the company was not able to meet the country’s new KYC requirements in time, as stated in an announcement on their site Tuesday, Feb. 6.The new, stricter anti money laundering regulations in South Korea were first announced in late December and  took effect on Jan. 30. Now all cryptocurrency exchanges in the country must ensure that all of their customers use their real names and associated bank accounts when performing crypto-fiat trades.According to their statement, the Coinpia exchange had stopped accepting fiat deposits on Jan. 30 in order to meet the requirements of the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Coinpia’s decision to halt trading came “[i]n the absence of a clear solution”, as the company had not been able to set up the necessary systems for user verification with banks in time.As Cointelegraph reported last week, the day after the KYC law went into effect, the Korea Customs Service (KCS) published a press release that revealed that more than $600 mln in digital currency had been traded under the new law.",42201
49,1751,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commision (CFTC) and US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) met the morning of February 6 2018 to discuss their roles in Blockchain, virtual currencies, and ICOs. Set in Washington D.C. at the Dirksen Senate Building, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs met in open session for about 2 hours. Before the hearing began, testimonies were released on behalf of both witnesses.The Pre-Testimonies(these testimonies were released on February 5 2018)J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairman and witness of the CFTC, expressed optimism in his testimony towards Blockchain/DLT, dedicating a page and a half (VI. Potential Benefits) to the numerous ways financial institutions, charities, social services, agriculture, and logistics can all benefit from it. Giancarlo seemed very bullish on allowing more freedoms for DLT, even comparing it to the internet:“This simple approach is well-recognized as the enlightened regulatory underpinning of the Internet that brought about such profound changes to human society. During the almost 20 years of “do no harm” regulation, a massive amount of investment was made in the Internet’s infrastructure. It yielded a rapid expansion in access that supported swift deployment and mass adoption of Internet-based technologies. Internet-based innovations have revolutionized nearly every aspect of American life, from telecommunications to commerce, transportation and research and development. [“Do] no harm” was unquestionably the right approach to development of the Internet. Similarly, I believe that “do no harm” is the right overarching approach for distributed ledger technology. “Despite his optimism, the chairman still stated that digital currencies will “likely require more attentive regulatory oversight” in regards to “fraud and manipulation.” But in his conclusion, he addressed that the SEC and CFTC should do their best to leave room for growth:“As we saw with the development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response.”Jay Clayton, the chairman of the SEC, was a little less excited about virtual currencies - but he also wasn’t denying their role in a modern financial ecosystem.“To be clear, I am very optimistic that developments in financial technology will help facilitate capital formation, providing promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike. From a financial regulatory perspective, these developments may enable us to better monitor transactions, holdings and obligations (including credit exposures) and other activities and characteristics of our markets, thereby facilitating our regulatory mission, including, importantly, investor protection.”But he also admitted that there still lay many traps:“At the same time, regardless of the promise of this technology, those who invest their hard-earned money in opportunities that fall within the scope of the federal securities laws deserve the full protections afforded under those laws. This ever-present need comes into focus when enthusiasm for obtaining a profitable piece of a new technology “before it’s too late” is strong and broad. Fraudsters and other bad actors prey on this enthusiasm.”SEC Chairman Clayton and CFTC Chairman Giancarlo, image source: c-spanWhile Giancarlo mentions the word “ICO” once in his testimony, Clayton mentions it 132 times.A recent study has found that 10% of all ICO proceeds have been lost to hacks and fraud, and Clayton’s fear is that many uneducated investors are losing lots of money. He even went on to promote Facebook’s recent ICO advertising ban:“I do want to recognize that recently social media platforms have restricted the ability of users to promote ICOs and cryptocurrencies on their platforms. I appreciate the responsible step.”Clayton goes on to praise the innovations of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology), better known as “Blockchain”, but hopeful to create some boundaries for ICOs.“Simply said, we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and markets.”The General StanceClayton has mentioned that he and Giancarlo have “built a strong relationship.” They are willing to work together to come up with a robust regulatory framework. In the simplest of terms, there seems to be a gradient that starts at ICOs, to virtual currencies, and then to DLT. DLT needs the least regulation, and in fact both the SEC and CTFC seem to encourage anyone willing to expand on it. ICOs are on the other side, requiring the most regulation, and virtual currencies are in the middle, needing protection against fraud and market manipulation.Today’s TestimonyToday’s hearing was refreshing in the sense that both Chairman Giancarlo and Chairman Clayton remained excited about the potential of decentralized technology and cryptocurrencies throughout the hearing.Clayton broke it down into 3 categories: DLT (distributed ledger technology), cryptocurrencies, and ICOs. As stated in the pre-testimonies, the CTFC was interested in allowing growth for DLT and cryptocurrencies, while keeping a watchful eye on fraudsters in ICOs.Giancarlo was very bullish in his sentiments towards cryptocurrency. In his opening statement he said that “we owe it to this generation to respect this generation's interest in cryptocurrencies, and punish those who persecute.” He talked about how interested his children were in the Bitcoin world and it was exciting to see them so interested in finance.He also mentioned Lab CFC: the CFTC’s organization to educate Main Street on cryptocurrencies. Giancarlo stressed that education was the most important route to take when overseeing cryptocurrencies; the CFTC has never conducted as much educational outreach as they have in this area.Senator Crapo mentioned that neither agencies have complete jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies and ICOs. Giancarlo and Clayton both agreed that they “may need additional authorities to regulate,” but before they can agree to that they must learn more about the crypto space. Clayton also briefly touched on the issue that the SEC does not have enough money to hire more people.When Senator Cotton asked Giancarlo about the value of Bitcoin, Giancarlo replied with “If there was no Bitcoin, there would be no DLT.” Both Clayton and Giancarlo know that cryptocurrencies are important for the development of DLT, and want to see the technology grow without getting anyone hurt in the process. Giancarlo also said that Bitcoin’s floor could not be zero. This is because Bitcoin’s value is “tied to mining.”There wasn’t much talk at all about tax regulation. Clayton and Giancarlo also admitted that they have no jurisdiction over nation states, such as Venezuela, using cryptocurrencies to avoid sanctions.Clayton did mention that while ETFs in Bitcoin are currently not ready, but that “there will be room in the future.”Lastly, Senator Warren asked Clayton how they can make ICOs safer. Clayton responded that many ICOs are, in fact, violating existing laws and that ICOs “should pay more attention” because the SEC is going to be investigating these violations further.The best solution, according to both Giancarlo and Clayton, would be to:Educate the masses about Bitcoin and cryptocurrenciesUse the jurisdiction that they have over the futures markets of Bitcoin to collect data and keep track of the markets so that nobody gets too hurtUse taskforce to go after “fraudsters” who are scamming Main Street investors in ICO pyramid schemes, and worthless cryptocurrencies.In summary, cryptocurrencies will allow growth for the United States the same way that the internet did. The United States should be a leader in this aspect, and make sure that nobody gets hurt in the process. Crypto HODL’ers alike all agree that the news was very bullish.On a side note, Giancarlo thinks “HODL” is an acronym for “Hold On for Dear Life.”",131835
